Today there was a new release of PHP - version 5.6.0 is out! And it contains some very interesting changes I think!

## variadic functions

Don't you just hate to use the mysterious function `func_get_args` in PHP? These times are over now (or whenever PHP 5.6 is hardened and ready to use in production ...) and PHP now has complete variadic functions:

```php
function foo($bar, ...$baz) {
	// $baz is an array of parameters given
}

foo(1, 2, 3, 4);
// $bar = 1, $baz = [2, 3, 4]
```

## exponentiation operator

Finally! I have been waiting long for this and now you can do this in PHP:

```php
2 ** 3 == 8;
```

It's only a new operator, but I like it and I think it follows the principle of least surprise, because that's what I searched for when using exponentiation for the first time in PHP.

## conclusion

PHP 5.6 moves closer to other script languages by adding features that have existed a very long time in e.g. Ruby or Python.
Of course there are many more changes, [check out the changelog](http://de2.php.net/migration56.new-features) if you're interested.
