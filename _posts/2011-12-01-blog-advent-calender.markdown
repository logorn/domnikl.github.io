<p>Today is December 1st and that means you can open the first door of your advent calender! :) The company I work for also has an advent calender. Every day from today till the 24th a new blog post will be published on our company's blog <a href="http://blog.mayflower.de" target="_blank">blog.mayflower.de</a>. Some posts will be in german, some in english.</p>
<p>Anyway some interesting topics will be covered including Symfony2, test driven Javascript development and CSS frameworks to name just a few. And there will be an article from me, too ;-)</p>
<p>Again this year, there's also <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2011" target="_blank">phpadvent.org</a> with new articles about topics around PHP every day.</p>
<p>Have fun! :)</p>
