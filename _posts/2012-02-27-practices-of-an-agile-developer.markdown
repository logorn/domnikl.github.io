<p>I often ask myself: "What can I do to improve my daily work, to become more efficient and a better developer in the non-technical sense?" In the end, it's all about being agile. But what does that mean? I assume you already know about the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">agile manifesto</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: small;">Individuals and interactions </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">over processes and tools<br />
</span><span style="font-size: small;">Working software </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">over comprehensive documentation<br />
</span><span style="font-size: small;">Customer collaboration </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">over contract negotiation<br />
</span><span style="font-size: small;">Responding to change </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">over following a plan</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The book "Practices of an agile developer" gave me some good tips on getting <em>'more agile'.</em> It's not one of these books that give you just a detailed text about what those four lines mean, it's merely meant to be a guideline that will guide you through the day if you are working in an agile team.</p>
<p>Each section begins describing the non-agile way and then tells why this is bad and what you should do to get better results.</p>
<p>The best about the book is <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/pad/PAD-pulloutcard.pdf" target="_blank">this</a>, a PDF that summarizes all guidelines from the book with a short description. If you want to read it, you can grab a copy <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't get money for this link, I just read this book and found it worthy to be mentioned here! In fact, I love the books from Pragmatic Programmers, I read Programming Ruby, Metaprogramming Ruby, The RSpec Book, Programming Erlang - Software for a concurrent world, Agile web development with Rails and I'm currently reading Pragmatic Thinking and Learning.</p>
