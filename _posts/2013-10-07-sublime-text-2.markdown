<p>As a software developer I am always searching for the best tool chain that helps me to write code more efficiently and faster. I am always testing new tools, discarding those that don&#39;t give me what I need to be productive.</p>
<p>And a big role in my day-to-day work plays the most basic tool, a text editor (who would&#39;ve thought that?). While on the console there&#39;s <code>vim</code>, a graphical user interface on my developing machine makes sense, too.</p>
<p>For a long time (about 3 years), I was an excited user of <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> and I still love this editor. But at the same time, I had to use <a href="https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a> on my Thinkpad at work. As you can guess, this wasn&#39;t a very satisfying challenge to use two very different editors of which only TextMate had nearly all of the features I would want on a text editor.</p>
<p>When a colleage mentioned <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>, I was all ears and soon buyed a license for myself. And I haven&#39;t regretted it.<br><br />
I have to say I use it for small scripts, writing blog articles in markdown and stuff like that but that&#39;s what this editor is really good in!</p>
<h2>Killer feature: line selections</h2>
<p>Sublime Text 2 has all the neat little features you know from TextMate or others (writing text, of course) but there is one outstanding feature that I like most: you can write in more than one line at a time. you can do this by selecting multiple lines of code and then press <code>CTRL</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>L</code> and then you can do anything you would with a single cursor, but now you write in all previously selected lines.</p>
<p>Of course you can leave this mode by pressing ESC.</p>
<p>For more information, just look at the demonstration video on <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublimetext.com</a>.<br><br />
Happy coding!</p>
