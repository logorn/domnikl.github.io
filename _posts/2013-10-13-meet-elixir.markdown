<h1>Meet Elixir</h1>
<blockquote><p>Elixir is a functional, meta-programming aware language built on top of the Erlang VM. It is a dynamic language with flexible syntax and macro support that leverages Erlang's abilities to build concurrent, distributed and fault-tolerant applications with hot code upgrades.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's what the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> homepage says. It's a language I am much interested in and I am learning at the moment. I will definitely write more in the next view months about it. But meanwhile, let me tell you about a nice way to learn that stuff.</p>
<h2>Video killed the book star</h2>
<p>As I have read several books whenever I learnt a new programming languages, I wanted to try something new this time and I found out about the <em>Meet Elixir</em> videos that are available through <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/elixir">Peepcode</a>.</p>
<p>The good thing about it is that the video doesn't just show boring sequences of features the language has but it is more in the style of an programming job interview. The interviewer has several small tasks in a queue and <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim">Jose Valim</a> (creator of Elixir) solves them in test-driven development fashion, which is a pretty cool way to show features and real-world usages.</p>
<p>You can easily follow along and pause/unpause the video while running your own tests and code.</p>
