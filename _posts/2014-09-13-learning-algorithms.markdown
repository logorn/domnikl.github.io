Today I am going to write just a very short article. In the recent days am doing a lot of noob work, learning Go and Clojure for fun. But today I will show you a page where can learn about a topic I am very interested in: algorithms.

There is lesson on [learneroo](https://www.learneroo.com/subjects/8) about it and it covers all the basics: sorting and searching in trees and graphs. The single challenges are very interesting and although the lessons are in Java, you can of course use the language of your choice to do the challenges (including Golang and Clojure ;-)).

Have fun doing it!
