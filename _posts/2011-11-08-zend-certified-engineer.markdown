    regarding ZCE...I'd like to add that information here: \r\n\r\nhttp://getstreaming.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/zend-certified-engineer/"

  content: Hey Jan, congrats! The company I work for bought the mockup tests for me
    but as far as I know Zend (not quite sure if the mockup tests were from Zend or
    another company) doesn't sell them anymore.

<p>Yeah big news today! In the morning I made the exam for the Zend Certified Engineer PHP 5.3 and passed it :)</p>
<p>I had many, many stream questions in my test, a field I wasn't so prepared about. I made three mockup tests to prepare for the exam (and of course reading the exam book, doing some examples in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/phpsh" target="_blank">phpsh</a>) but I think the real test had much harder questions than the mockup tests. In the end all that matters is that I passed it ;-)</p>
<p>It was my first certificate, but it won't be the last! On the beginning of 2012 I want to do the MySQL certificate and perhaps Zend Framework too.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to ask me questions about it if you're doing the exam, too! Besides I really recommend installing <a href="https://github.com/facebook/phpsh" target="_blank">phpsh</a> on your machine if you're doing PHP development. I can't say it often enough and it has saved me a lot of headaches in my daily work with PHP :)</p>
<p>As I re-read this post it occured to me that this is no post, it's merely a brain dump ... :D</p>
