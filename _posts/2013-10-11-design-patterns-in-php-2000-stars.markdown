<p>Some 2 years ago, I started a little <a href="https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP">project on Github</a>. I felt I needed to learn all object-orientation design patterns and I needed to do that with PHP.</p>
<p>So I <a href="https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP/tree/e730ee6e8eca26fbd659ead0835b1c4f62eca6d0">started to write examples</a> for all the patterns and structured them in files just like I would do with any other code.</p>
<p>By now my little experiment has just reached 2.000 stars on Github and has long been the most starred PHP project on the platform and was mentioned in several <a href="http://academe.co.uk/2013/05/php-design-patterns/">blog articles</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1l0g4a/what_should_a_php_developer_know/cbuj4pe">reddit comments</a> and was <a href="http://phpmagazin.de/DesignPatternsf%C3%BCrPHPaufderGeekSiteoftheWeek">'Geek site of the Week'</a> in PHPMagazin.</p>
<p>I also received several mails with praise and questions regarding design patterns and their use in PHP. Please keep that up and let's talk about quality PHP code!</p>
<p>Thank you all who participated and helped me in the process of building this great piece of documentation and for all tweets, blog posts and comments about it!</p>
