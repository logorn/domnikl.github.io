- getting faster to results as puppet
- no ruby, just python needed on remote (per default on every modern Linux distro anyway)
- verbose mode => see how it works => sample
- easy to install through homebrew, apt-get, etc.
- complete list of tasks: https://gist.github.com/marktheunissen/2979474
- events with handlers (restart, regenerate, etc.)
- you only need to know and use yml (and shell scripts for complex and custom tasks)
- even suited for deployment (I don't do that)
- if you don't do it now: use infrastructure as code
- integrates nicely with Vagrant through as a provisioner (link)
- show sample with templates
