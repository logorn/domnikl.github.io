<p>Owning Android devices since about 1 1/2 years now, I have to admit I love that platform a lot more than iOS. Mostly because getting into programming for these is a lot easier than with Apple's OS. All you need is a computer running OSX, Linux or Windows and (though it is optional) a mobile device or tablet running Android. No need for expensive certificates or such. Programming is done using the Java programming language and an IDE that uses Eclipses as the base.</p>
<h2>Times have changed</h2>
<p>But that is about to change. IntelliJ is becoming more and more popular amongst Java developers and so Google decided to switch to that platform. The current version of <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a> is v0.2.x, which means it's not yet stable but worth a look nevertheless.</p>
<p>I have to admit I had some troubles running my current project (an English vocubulary trainer) on my Macbook. I always test on my hardware device (LG Nexus 4) but the Studio didn't recognize it as a debuggable device, so I was forced to use the simulator.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all the new platform looks promising and I already love doing PHP development with PhpStorm and used RubyMine for a lot of Ruby development.<br />
I am looking forward to test it soon again when it's more stable and ready to use!</p>
