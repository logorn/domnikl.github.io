title: why auto_increments and sequences are anti patterns
---
<p>One of the first things every Junior Developer learns regarding relational database systems is that storing integers is fast, it doesn't take much space and Â in general, you should favor an integer over a character field if you've got the choice.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-328"></a></p>
<p>There's nothing wrong about that, just remember that a database system can handle values that have a fixed length much faster than values that have a variable length. So naturally it would be a good choice to auto generate an unique sequential integer and store it as the primary key to identify the row in the table.</p>
<p>But there's a reason that most NoSQL data stores don't use sequential IDs. And that's a lession that RDBMS can learn from these. If you take a look around there are SHA1 hashes, "natural" data like the URL as the primary key in Google's Bigtable and you wouldn't use a sequential integer to identify key-value pairs in Redis or Memcache, or would you?</p>
<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
<p>All will be good until the day when your database server is just too slow to handle all incoming requests and you have to scale to a second. Most likely, you implement a sharding algorithm that will distribute the data equally on your two servers and if you need it, on a third one. You can't do that with your auto generated primary key.</p>
<p>Just think of this scenario: Server1 creates a new Invoice row and assigns the ID 1. In the same time, Server2 also creates a new Invoice row and assigns ID 1. How would you know which is which?</p>
<p><a href="http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/10853187575/sharding-ids-at-instagram" target="_blank">Instagram solved this issue</a> by generating (big integer) IDs that are not sequential but hold a lot of information in it, e.g. a shard number and the current timestamp.</p>
<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
<p>Your app needs a mobile frontend that could also be used when being offline and that syncs all the content to the server when the mobile device is back online again. You would need to identify the new items and the ones that still exist. This is not going to happen well if you use auto-increment values in the database.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>Don't rely on auto-generated sequential values in your database. In general don't rely on sequential values. Better use UUIDs instead. PostgreSQL already comes with a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-uuid.html" target="_blank">uuid type</a>, or you can generate a unique ID in your application or via a short PLSQL function as Instagram did.</p>
<p>For other RDBMS, generate the UUID in your application, every language has it's own library (or several) to do that. Or you could simply use the <a title="man 1 uuidgen" href="http://manpages.sgvulcan.com/uuidgen.1.php" target="_blank">uuidgen</a> tool on Linux/Mac to do that (ONLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FASTER POSSIBILITY).</p>
<p>Use a fixed length character column in your database and set the primary key on it and you'll have a much more flexible solution :)</p>
