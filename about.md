Hello,

<div style="float: right;">
	<img src="../images/IMG_3502.jpg" style="height: 250px; width: auto;"/>
</div>

my name is Dominik and I live in central Germany. I am currently 30 years old and love programming, guitars, photography and Scotch whisky.

I have over <script type="text/javascript">var year = new Date().getFullYear(); year -= 2006; document.write(year);</script> years of experience programming in various languages including PHP, Ruby, C, JavaScript, Elixir and Java and love to experiment with new languages and systems. I like Open Source and have contributed patches and bug reports to many different projects including **Doctrine2**, **PHP_CodeSniffer** and **Active MQ Apollo**. I am also author of some Ruby, PHP and Erlang libraries that you can find on [Github](https://github.com/domnikl) including [highscore](https://github.com/domnikl/highscore), [DesignPatternsPHP](https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP) and [statsd-php](https://github.com/domnikl/statsd-php).

I am currently working with [flyeralarm](http://www.flyeralarm.com) with experience of more than <script type="text/javascript">var year = new Date().getFullYear(); year -= 2006; document.write(year);</script> years in professional software development. I also like playing the guitar (check out my band [Afraid Of Carpets](https://afraidofcarpets.com)), soldering guitar effects pedals and [photography](https://liebler-photography.com).

My blog is all about software development and trending technologies and sometimes just rants ;-) But I will try to keep them at a minimum. If you like my posts or have ideas for new posts, don't hesitate to contact me.
